                    <BR>She tries to hide her grief, but it leads to her becoming emotionally withdrawn, while Jeremy turns to drugs to avoid dealing with his own feelings.

                                    This leaves both her ex-boyfriend Matt jealous and her friend Caroline who also likes Stefan sees her as her rival. 
                                    <BR>Elena's friend, Bonnie, encourages Elena to go for it and talk to him, but she is unconvinced to leaving her social isolation.

        <P>
            The semi-psychic Bonnie tells Elena that she has a bad feeling about Stefan, <BR>
            so Elena decides to invite Stefan and Bonnie to have dinner at her house so that they can get to know each other better. <BR>
            At school, Tyler attempts to humiliate Stefan by throwing a football at him,<br>
             but it backfires as Stefan uses his vampire speed to effortlessly catch the ball and passes it back.<br>
              Stefan ends up joining the football team, at Elena's urging.<br>
               During dinner, Damon and Caroline unexpectedly show up, and Elena "invites" him into her house.<br>
                Stefan gives Elena a necklace filled with vervain to protect her from Damon. <br>
                When Stefan attempts to convince Damon that he still has some humanity left in him,<br>
             Damon attacks and kills Mr. Tanner in retaliation.

        <p>
            Elena and Stefan go to the town's annual Founders' Party, hosted by Tyler's parents.<br>
             Vicki gets Tyler to ask her when she refuses to associate herself with Jeremy. <br>
             Damon tells Elena about the history of the Salvatores after Stefan tries to cut Damon out of his life.<br>
              Damon also retrieves an amber crystal from one of the historical artifacts in the Lockwood Estate.<br>
               Meanwhile, Stefan uses Caroline as a vessel to poison Damon.<br>
                When Damon sucks Caroline's blood, he falls ill. Once Caroline wakes up,<br>
                 she sees the amber crystal and puts it in her purse unaware of its power.<br>
                  Stefan locks up a weakened Damon at the Salvatore property with their distant nephew Zach to stand guard.<br>

                   and reporter Logan Fell, have come to the conclusion that vampires have returned to Mystic Falls due to the drained bodies,<br>
                    and they must retrieve a pocket watch that belongs to the Gilbert family.<br>
